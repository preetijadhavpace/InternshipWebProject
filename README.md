# InternshipWebProject
This project is a front-end simulation of an e-commerce shopping website built using standard web technologies. It includes multiple pages such as the home page, product listings, product detail views, shopping cart, checkout, contact, and about pages.

The website layout is responsive and designed to work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. It is ideal for showcasing front-end development skills, especially UI structuring, component design, and responsive layout creation.
